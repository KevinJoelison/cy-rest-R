## Introduction
This is a collection of R workflows to use Cytoscaep from R via [cyREST app](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cyrest).

## Updates
* 6/15/2015 - First release


## System Requirments
### Supported platforms
* Mac OS X (tested on Yosemite)
* Windows (tested on Windows 8.1 64 bit)
* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 14.0.4)

### Reruired Software Packages
* [R](http://www.r-project.org/) (Tested on R version 3.2.0)
* Latest version of [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) 3.2.1 or later
* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)
    * Some of the examples are written in [R Markdown format](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).  RStudio is the best application to render and execute them.

#### R Packages
* [RJSON](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjson/index.html)
* [igraph](http://igraph.org/r/)
* [httr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html)

## How to Use

### Quick Start Guide
* Install all required software
* Start Cytoscape
* Open web browser and visit [cyREST page in App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cyrest)
* Click ___Install___ button to directly install the App from this page
    * Note: __Do NOT install app from App menu.__ It installs older version of cyREST.  This is a known bug in Cytoscape.
* Clone this repository
* Open the directory with RStudio
* Run ```r_markdown/basic1.Rmd``` to start basic workflow

### Workflows
There are some _workflow*_ R files in the top directory.  They are designed to star from an empty Cytoscape session. To run these scripts, simply start Cytoscape and run the R script from R console.  Make sure you installed all dependencies!

#### Workflow 1: Automatic layout and visualization based on network structure
This workflow is designed to demonstrate how the combination of Cytoscape and igraph makes your network visualization better than manual visuaization. It executes the following steps automatically:

1. Load SIF network file (yeast network)
1. Extract largest connected component (subgraph)
1. Remove duplicate edges
1. Calculate basic statistics including:
    * Betweenness
    * PageRank
    * Edge Betweenness
1. Find community structures using multiple algorithms
1. Convert it into Cytoscpae-conpatible JSON
1. Generate visual style using statistics and community structure calculated above
1. Send the data to Cytoscape
1. Run Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm using community structure
1. Visualize it

You can use your own network if you want.

#### Workflow 2: [HumanNet](http://www.functionalnet.org/humannet/about.html) visualization with automatic annotations
